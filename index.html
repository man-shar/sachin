			<span>Sachin Tendulkar:</span>
			<span>The Greatest of All Time</span>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="wrapper">
		<div class="intro">
			<span>
				The task of proving that Sachin Tendulkar seems easy due to the magnitude of what he accomplished and his stature in India, but when you start to look for contenders, there are a lot of them. At first I began to look into older players like Sir Don Bradman, Viv Richards, etc. But then I soon realised, Sachin and others of his generation had long surpassed their predecessors jut by their longevity and the sheer number of matches they played. Sir Don Bradman played just 52 test matches in his entire career. Sachin played 200. He never even played ODIs. Sachin, however played 464 of them. <br>
				<br>
				Although the older players do not have that much of an effect on Sachin's place in history, I will still display their statistics in the following charts just to prove my point of why it doesn't matter who we compare Sachin to. Looking at Wisden's 100, I decided on five batsmen who I feel would be the best ones to compare Sachin to in order to validate my argument. They are- Sir Don Bradman, Sir Viv Rochards, Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid and Jacques Kallis. 
				Let's begin!

		<div class="average">
			<h1>Career Averages</h1>
			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					One of the most basic things which cricket gurus compare batsman by is their career batting averages. It not only gives an idea about the players growth but also his consistency. If he is ever a bad performer, it shows up in his average. His total runs still increase, but his average falls.
					<br><br>

					The following chart shows the batting averages throughut the career of six batsmen- Sachin, Bradman, Viv Richards, Dravid, Ponting and Kallis. Scroll over the chart to see the averages of the various players at a particular match in their career. See the legend on the right for reference.

			<div class="average_viz">

			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					Sir Don Bradman is incomparable here if seen by absolute numbers. He retired with an average of 99.75. Insane. But the fact that he played just 53 test matche in his career, is a major negative point. He was a brilliant and a very consistent batsman, but just did not play for long so as to fairly compare. THe other batsman are all very similar in terms of their growth and averages through the careers with all aveaging around the 45+ mark. Thus the criteria to judge here is longevity. Sachin wins in longevity outright. He played 664 international matches in his career. Most by any player ever. The second in out pool is RIcky Ponting, with 543. More than a 100 matches less than Sachin. Thus here, the criteria boils down to longevity and hence Sachin leads.
				</span>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="runs">
			<h1>Career Runs</h1>
			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					Another method to compare various batsmen is the runs they scored in their career. It is a good metric of seeing a player's consistency as a flatter line will show lower consistency and vice versa.
					<br><br>

					The following chart shows the cumulative career runs (Tests+ODI) throughut the career of six batsmen- Sachin, Bradman, Viv Richards, Dravid, Ponting and Kallis. Scroll over the chart to see the net runs of the various players at a particular match in their career. See the legend on the right for reference.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="runs_viz">
			</div>
			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					No one commpares to Sachin here. His total of 34347 runs in his career is most by any cricketer ever. During the end of Ponting's career, he and Sachin were neck and neck but Sachin, as always beats everyone else in longevity of his career. Second is Ponting with 27082 runs. 
				</span>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="wickets">
			<h1>Wickets</h1>
			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					Since we are comparing the players as "Cricketers" and not as batsmen only, I also will look at their bowling figures. Bowling economy would be a good metric but it was very close and did not how the true picture. So I went with wickets taken by the players.
					<br><br>

					The following chart shows the cumulative wickets taken throughut the career of six batsmen- Sachin, Bradman, Viv Richards, Dravid, Ponting and Kallis. Scroll over the chart to see the wickets of the various players at a particular match in their career. See the legend on the right for reference.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="wickets_viz">
			</div>
			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					Kallis was a great bowler. He was almost a bowling specialist in many regards. But since he was a great batsman too, he deserves a place among these players. Here Kallis leaves everyone way behind. The only competition coming from Sachin who took 201 wickets while Kallis took 577. Kallis first, Sachin second.
				</span>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="kvs">
			<h1>Kallis vs Sachin</h1>
			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					Boiling down, we are really left with only one competitor for Sachin- Jacques Kallis. They were both neck and neck in the average and runs scored with Sachin's longevity proving crucialto give him the lead. While Kallis took a trmendous lead in the wickets taken section.
					<br><br>
					Thinking of ways of comparing the two, I came up with a new method to look at things. I will see the fraction of the player's score over his team's score in matches. I will look at player's scores above 25% of the team scores in ODI'd only. Because when we compare tests, there comes a point of which inning to choose,to choose both as one or separately. Therefore, to best test these two, I will look at only ODIs where the player scored more than 25% of the team's score.

					Each bubble in the following chart is a match. Scroll over the bubbles to see details about the match. See the legend for reference.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="kvs_viz">
			</div>
			<div class="intro">
				<span>
					Sachin very clearly wins here. The number of matches where Sachin scored more than 50% of the team's score are 17. Kallis's? Just 1. Above 25%? Kallis: 81. Sachin:136. Think about that for a second. In 136 matches in his career, which is 1/5th of his career, Sachin scored 1/4th of his long career team's score. Thats amazing! He did what no one could in so many occasions that talking about each match can make an entire project like this one. Thus we see Sachin takes a huge leap above others just because of his resilience and ability to step up when no one else in the team did.

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<div class="intro">
		<span>
			Above charts and graphics show us just how important Sachin'scontribution to cricket have been. He became the life of this nation with all the weight on his shoulders. He carried it off with grace an the numbers show that. He not only scored consistently, he did that for 22 years on the international circuit. He broker every record there is. Left all his peers behind who have nothing by respect for him. Such was his class. "Sach" is the man.
